# Real-Estate-Website-React-JS
I am creating a mobile application that connects farmers directly with consumers and retailers. The app should include features for listing produce, negotiating prices, and managing transactions, thereby reducing dependence on intermediaries. 


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



To Start use => npm run dev
